# Event Sourcing Learning Journey - Session 1

## ðŸ“… Date: September 17, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Overview
Today we began the event sourcing learning journey outlined in `Plan.md`, focusing on Phase 1: C# Basics & Simple Entities. Successfully completed the first 4 tasks and established the foundation for our domain model.

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Create Your First Entity** âœ…
**File:** `Therapist.cs`
- âœ… Created entity with `Id`, `Name`, `LicenseNumber`
- âœ… Constructor validation: Name not empty, LicenseNumber exactly 8 digits
- âœ… Property encapsulation: `public get; private set;`
- âœ… Auto-generated GUID for identity

**Key Learning:**
- Domain entities need identity and validation
- Property encapsulation prevents external state mutations
- Constructor is the gatekeeper for valid entity creation

**Debugging Process:** Learned about common mistakes:
- ID assignment logic errors (initializing vs constructor parameter)
- Property visibility patterns (private vs public accessors)
- Validation order (null checks before length checks)

### **Task 2: Value Objects** âœ…
**File:** `TimeSlot.cs`
- âœ… Created record with `StartTime`, `EndTime`
- âœ… Immutable properties with `init` accessors
- âœ… Validation: EndTime must be after StartTime
- âœ… Business method: `GetDuration()` returns minutes

**Key Learning:**
- **Records vs Classes:** Records for value objects (immutable, value equality)
- **Entities vs Value Objects:** TimeSlot has no identity - defined by its values
- **DateTime arithmetic:** `EndTime - StartTime` returns `TimeSpan`
- Records can have methods, constructors, and validation like classes

### **Task 3: Entity with Business Logic** âœ…
**File:** `Patient.cs`
- âœ… Created entity with `Id`, `Name`, `DateOfBirth`
- âœ… Business methods: `GetAge()`, `IsMinor()`
- âœ… Complex age calculation handling birthdays correctly

**Key Learning:**
- **Age Calculation Logic:** Understanding the birthday adjustment pattern:
  ```csharp
  if (DateOfBirth.Date > DateTime.Today.AddYears(-age)) age--;
  ```
  This checks if birthday hasn't occurred yet this year
- **DateTime vs TimeSpan:** Cannot do `DateTime - DateTime = DateTime`
- **Business logic in entities:** Age and minor status are computed properties

**Technical Deep Dive:** Analyzed the birthday logic systematically:
- `DateTime.Today.AddYears(-age)` = "What date was it X years ago?"
- Comparison determines if birthday has passed this year
- Essential for accurate age calculation

### **Task 4: Collections in Entities** âœ…
**File:** `Therapist.cs` (Enhanced)
- âœ… Added `List<DayOfWeek> FreeDays` with private setter
- âœ… Method `IsAvailableOn(DayOfWeek day)`
- âœ… Method `AddAvailableDay(DayOfWeek day)` with duplicate prevention
- âœ… Used built-in `System.DayOfWeek` enum

**Key Learning:**
- **Collection Management:** Private setters prevent external list manipulation
- **Enum Usage:** Leveraged built-in enums vs creating custom ones
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Check `Contains()` before adding
- **API Design:** Method names should be intuitive (`IsAvailableOn` vs `CheckFreeDay`)

**Debugging Journey:** Encountered and fixed:
- Custom enum conflicts with built-in enums
- Invalid syntax: `enum DayOfWeek day` â†’ `DayOfWeek day`
- Wrong variable reference: `Add(DayOfWeek)` â†’ `Add(day)`

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Mastered

### **Entity vs Value Object Design**
- **Entities:** Have identity, mutable, use classes
  - `Therapist`, `Patient` - represent "things" with identity
- **Value Objects:** No identity, immutable, use records
  - `TimeSlot` - represents a value, not a thing

### **Property Encapsulation Patterns**
```csharp
public Guid Id { get; } = Guid.NewGuid();           // Read-only, auto-generated
public string Name { get; private set; }            // Readable, internally mutable
public DateTime StartTime { get; init; }            // Set once during construction
```

### **Validation Strategies**
1. **Constructor validation:** Ensure objects are born valid
2. **Null checks first:** Prevent NullReferenceException
3. **Business rule validation:** Domain-specific constraints
4. **Meaningful exceptions:** `ArgumentException`, `ArgumentNullException`

### **C# DateTime Mastery**
- `DateTime.Today` vs `DateTime.Now`
- `DateTime - DateTime = TimeSpan`
- `AddYears()` for date arithmetic
- `.Date` property strips time component

## ðŸ’¡ Teaching Methodology Insights

### **Effective Learning Pattern**
1. **Implement first** - Let learner try
2. **Review systematically** - Identify specific issues
3. **Explain problems** - Don't give solutions immediately
4. **Guide debugging** - Teach problem-solving process
5. **Provide context** - Explain "why" behind patterns

### **Code Review Approach**
- Focus on one issue at a time
- Use concrete examples showing failure cases
- Explain business impact of technical decisions
- Encourage learner to fix issues themselves

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Goals

### **Task 5: Simple Session Entity**
- Understand aggregate design patterns
- Implement `MediationSession` with proper ID relationships
- Learn about entity relationships via IDs (not direct references)
- Status enum implementation and business rules

### **Conceptual Focus**
- **Aggregate boundaries:** What belongs in MediationSession?
- **Entity relationships:** Why use IDs instead of object references?
- **Status enums:** Modeling state in domain entities
- **Business rule validation:** When can sessions transition states?
